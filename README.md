# mnestix-browser-example-submodel-visualizations
An example submodel visualization to guide the user in the creation of their own custom visualization.
We recommend to use this repository as a template and replace the body of the React component.

This example visualization can be viewed with the mnestix AAS `https://vws.xitaso.com/aas/mnestix`, which is uploaded as a default AAS.
